## Test Results Summary

### Discovery Run 1: DISCOVERY_RUN_1_20250704_150008

#### Issues Found:
1. **[HIGH]** WebFetch tool cannot perform actual form submissions
   - **Impact:** Initial testing approach limited
   - **Solution:** Switched to direct API testing and Playwright browser automation

2. **[CRITICAL]** Customer Setup API field name mismatch
   - **Found:** API expects `legal_business_name` and `primary_contact_email`
   - **Form sends:** `company_name` and `customer_email`
   - **Location:** `/api/v1/forms/customer-setup/initiate` endpoint

### Browser Test Run: BROWSER_TEST_20250704_151628

#### Successful Tests:
1. **✅ Customer Setup Sales Initiation**
   - Form submission successful
   - Transaction ID generated: `9730c1c9-cbef-4dac-8b3c-4f469a82ab1e`
   - Email routing triggered

#### Failed Tests:
1. **[CRITICAL]** P66 LOI Form field mismatch
   - **Issue:** Test script looking for `contact_name` field
   - **Reality:** Form uses `authorized_representative` field
   - **Impact:** Form cannot be submitted via automation

## Database Issues Previously Fixed

### During Initial Testing:
1. **[CRITICAL]** Transaction status enum mismatch
   - **Fixed:** Changed `pending_signature` → `WAITING_SIGNATURE`
   - **Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

2. **[CRITICAL]** Missing transaction_type field
   - **Fixed:** Added `NEW_LOI_REQUEST` to INSERT statements
   - **Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

## Comprehensive Issue List for Batch Fix

### Priority 1: Critical Field Mismatches
1. **Customer Setup API Field Names**
   ```
   Frontend sends → API expects
   company_name → legal_business_name
   customer_email → primary_contact_email
   ```

2. **P66 LOI Contact Fields**
   ```
   Test expects → Form has
   contact_name → authorized_representative
   email → contact-email (ID)
   ```

### Priority 2: ESIGN Compliance Gaps
1. **EFT Form Missing ESIGN Consent**
   - No explicit consent checkbox found
   - ESIGN disclosure section needs to be added

2. **Signature Page Validation**
   - Need to verify ESIGN compliance implementation
   - Test consent checkbox requirement

### Priority 3: Email & Workflow Testing
1. **Email Delivery Verification**
   - Cannot access transaction.coordinator.agent@gmail.com inbox
   - Need alternative verification method

2. **Multi-step Form Workflows**
   - Customer Setup: Sales → Customer completion
   - EFT: Sales → Customer completion → Signature

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Fix all field name mismatches in batch
2. Update test scripts with correct field names
3. Add missing ESIGN compliance to EFT form
4. Create comprehensive test data fixtures

### Testing Strategy:
1. Run automated browser tests for all forms
2. Capture all issues without stopping
3. Batch fix all issues
4. Re-run tests until 100% success

### Success Metrics:
- [ ] All forms submit successfully
- [ ] All field names match between frontend and backend
- [ ] ESIGN compliance on all signature forms
- [ ] Database captures all form data correctly
- [ ] Email notifications sent (even if we can't verify delivery)
- [ ] Signature workflow completes end-to-end
