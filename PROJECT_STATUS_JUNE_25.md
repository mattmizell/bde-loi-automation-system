# LOI Automation System - Project Status
## Date: June 25, 2025, 4:35 PM

### Current Status: Deployment Issues Resolved ✓

#### What We Fixed Today:

1. **Database Connection Issues** ✓
   - Fixed DATABASE_URL parsing for special characters
   - Corrected malformed URL (was missing host component)
   - Added proper error handling and logging

2. **Search Functionality** ✓
   - Fixed proxy method handlers
   - Connected search endpoint to correct handler
   - Removed broken modular API proxy calls

3. **LACRM API Integration** ✓
   - Fixed authentication (UserCode extraction)
   - Fixed request format (data= instead of json=)
   - Documented all LACRM quirks and limitations
   - Added proper pagination handling

4. **Health Checks** ✓
   - Added HEAD request support for Render monitoring
   - Fixed 501 errors on health check endpoints

#### Remaining Issues:

1. **DATABASE_URL Configuration**
   - Current URL in Render is malformed
   - Should update to: `postgresql://loi_user:2laNcRN0ATESCFQg1mGhknBielnDJfiS@dpg-d1dd5nadbo4c73cmub8g-a/loi_automation`
   - This will fix all remaining connection errors

2. **Unified Modular Server**
   - Still not working in production
   - Falling back to integrated server for now
   - All functionality works through legacy endpoints

#### API Documentation for Adam:

Created comprehensive guide for migrating from direct LACRM API to our cached API:
- Much faster response times (instant vs 5-10 seconds)
- No pagination needed (all contacts in one request)
- Proper JSON responses (no text/html parsing issues)
- Background sync keeps data fresh

#### Key Files Modified:
- signature_storage.py - Database connection fixes
- integrated_pdf_signature_server.py - Proxy fixes, HEAD support
- bde_crm_bridge_service.py - Database connection fixes
- LACRM_API_DOCUMENTATION.md - Complete API guide
- ADAM_API_UPDATE.md - Migration guide for Adam

#### Next Steps:
1. Update DATABASE_URL in Render to correct value
2. Monitor logs to ensure all services start correctly
3. Test all endpoints once deployment completes
4. Move to Raspberry Pi IoT project
